        <p>In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London, 
            and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having 
            completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as 
            Assistant Surgeon.
